      <description>Medium.com was the first place where I started my dev doc journey. However, over the years, there were quite abit of changes to Medium and it was getting hard for non-members to read my post. The objective of my articles is to share knowledge, so I decided to use my Medium friend membership to share the links to my Medium articles here.&#xA;I still post my articles on Medium as it have better support for code syntax, so if you are not a Medium subscriber, you can still use the friendâ€™s link below to view the content of my articles on Medium for free.</description>
